# typhoonplots
Plots to visualize histones, transcription factors, and other DNA-binding proteins. Plot type created by the MacAlpine Lab, ported to Python by me.

Scripts:
* `typhoonPlot.py` Generates "typhoon plots" based off of one or more BAM/SAM files
* `typhoonPlot_multiWindows.py` Generates typhoon plots of a single BAM/SAM file across multiple windows
* `kernelDensityPlot.py` Generates kernel density plots off of one or more BAM/SAM files

Use `run.py` as a guide to run the three scripts in this repository.
